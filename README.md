# iris_data-classification
The iris_data.m file is the primary data.The Iris plant data set provided below contains 3 classes of 50 elements each, where each class refers to a type of the Iris plant. Each plant is characterised by its sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.  
The iris_database.m is the Backpropagation Neural Network which could recognize and classify these 3 classes of iris with 99.996% accurancy.
In my neural network,  I divide the primary data into two parts. The training part and test part.
